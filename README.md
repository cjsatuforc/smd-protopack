# Breadboarding protopack

Pack of PCB's for (SMD) prototyping, designed in Eagle, geared towards cheap PCB services such as Seeed and Dirty PCBs (no affiliation). 
Target is to create a single pack of very usable proto board on a 10x10cm area.

# Usage tips:

The boards can be fairly easily broken out of the panel on the holes. This will leave a rough spot, which can easily be trimmed with some sidecutting pliers or with a file or some sandpaper.
